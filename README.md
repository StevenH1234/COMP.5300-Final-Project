DATASET PREPERATION
Under the ColonINST documentation guideline all of the datasets are shown to construct the dataset. If you have permission you should download all datasets and follow the guidelines as instructed. 
Our team only downloaded the publicly available dataset which includes: BKAI-Small, CP-Child, CVC-ClinicDB, KVasic-Capsule, Kvasir-Instrument, Nerthus, and WCE-CCDD
Once you have downloaded all of the data please reference the data_reorganize.csv file which can be found here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ng2DQav-Gfts6hIr3_vCUC-a2gCWzzCO)
  - Update the file to include only the data that you have.
  - For CVC-ClinicDB data you will need to update the CSV file. Under the original column you will need to ensure that the format is labeled as a .tif file as the CSV file indicates it is a jpef file
After you have completed the above steps continue following the instructions from step 1 defined within ColonINST documentation
